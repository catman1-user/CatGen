# CatGen - a ClanGen Tool
by Nimaereth

CatGen is a [ClanGen](https://github.com/Thlumyn/clangen) tool used to create cats to add to your ClanGen save files.
This tool allows you to generate cats and export their corresponding .json files as well as their sprites as transparent .png files.
Your saved cats and images will be found in the savedcats folder. 


Please do not use generated images for commercial purposes, and do not claim any artwork as your own.

Requirements:
- pygame
- pygame-gui
- ujson

Disclaimer: this tool uses art assets and reuses code from [ClanGen](https://github.com/Thlumyn/clangen).


There is a [version that doesnt require thonny](https://nightly.link/nimaereth/catgen/workflows/build/master), but it is not guaranteed to work

Steps for adding exported cats to your Clan save:
